# About this blog
------
Hi, Iâ€™m Paul, a Web developer. This is my personal blog where I write programming-related stuff. I focus my attention on C and php. I also write other stuffs on this blog.  

Besides programming, I like football very much. I usually play football with my friends once a week. Watching and talking about football match on weekends is the best pleasure of me.

This blog is based on the template theme of [Jekyll](https://github.com/poole/lanyon). Thanks to the author!

Feel free to leave comments or contact me with my email: _cnjsw001(at)gmail.com_, especially if you spot an error.
